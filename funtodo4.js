// Only Keep the Last Few
// Stan learned something today: that directly decrementing an array’s .length immediately shortens it by that amount. Given array arr and number X, remove all except the last X elements, and return arr (changed and shorter). Given ([2,4,6,8,10],3), change the given array to [6,8,10] and return it.
function shift(arr, x){
	for (let i=0;i<arr.length-x;i++){
		arr.shift()
	}
	return arr
}
